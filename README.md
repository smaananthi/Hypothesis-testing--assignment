# ``` Hypothesis for Data Science```
### ```Hypothesis testing: ```
##### It is a method of inferential statisti used to determine the possible conclusion which has to be statistically proven or not.
### ```Sampling Distribution: ```
##### A Sampling Distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic obtained through a large number of samples drawn from a specific population.
### ```Null hypothesis H0: ```
##### States there is no statistical significance between two variables in the hypothesis.
### ```Aternate hypothesis H1: ```
##### States that there is a statistical significance between two variables.
### ```One-tail hypothesis test: ```
##### It is used whenever the alternative hypothesis is stated as < or > and null hypothesis is stated as >= or <=.
### ```Two-tail hypothesis test: ```
##### It is used whenever the alternative hypothesis is stated as ≠ and null hypothesis is stated as =.
### ```Type-I Error:```
##### Type-I error occurs when the sample results, lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is in fact true. .
### ```Type-II Error:```
##### Type-II error occurs when based on the sample results, the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is in fact false.
### ```Level of Significance (α):```
##### The level of significance is the measurement of the statistical significance. It defines whether the null hypothesis is assumed to be accepted or rejected.
### ```P value:```
##### P values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
### ```t-test:```
##### A t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two samples. It is used in hypothesis testing, with a null hypothesis that the difference in group means is zero and an alternate hypothesis that the difference in group means is different from zero.
### ```z-test:```
#####  z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different when the variances are known and the sample size is large.
### ```F-test:```
##### An F-test is any statistical test in which the test statistic has an F-distribution under the null hypothesis.
### ```Chi-square:```
##### Chi-square is a statistical test that examines the differences between categorical variables from a random sample in order to determine whether the expected and observed results are well-fitting.
### ```ANOVA:```
##### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical formula used to compare variances across the means (or average) of different groups. A range of scenarios use it to determine if there is any difference between the means of different groups.
